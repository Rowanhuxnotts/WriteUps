# Gamma Correction of lab monitors

Two monitors (Need specs) were used. 

A (Dimentions) patch was displayed in the center of each monitor and was used to take luminance recordings. 
16 luminance levels of the patch were recorded with RGB values starting at -1 and increased to 1 in steps of 0.125.
Luminance output of the monitors were quite comparable at each level, only differing by ~10 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.
The min and max values were 0.78 cd/m<sup>2</sup> and 186.4 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for the left monitor and 0.93 cd/m<sup>2</sup> and 197.4 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for the right monitor.
The patches were presented on a mean grey background with random dot noise around the patch (Size,rate of movemnet etc)

Both monitors were gamma corrected manually using a (luminance meter name) and then validated againt a PR655 luminance meter running automatically.
The manual readings were



The gamma from this was reasonably comparable for the left monitor (2.3853 cd/m2) but the right monitor gave a completely different reading which did not look right at all (4.7618 cd/m2). I ran it 3 times, but it was quite inconsistent. It seemed to take far longer to run than the left monitor so maybe it was having issues taking recordings that said, I didn't change anything between recording each monitor so I'm not sure why it would? Iâ€™ve kept my manual recording as it is in a more reasonable range when compared to the gamma calibration previously on the monitor (1.666 cd/m2).

## Notes from obsidian

Calibrated both manually and automatically (w/ the 655)

Automatic calibration-
Left monitor gamma = 2.3853
Right monitor gamma = 4.7618 (?????)


Manual calibration-
Recorded 16 equally spaced luminance values from 1-255 (skipped 0 as Paul recommended avoiding extreme values)

Left monitor gamma = 2.05741
